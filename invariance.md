# What is Invariance?

The term 'invariant' is one of the linchpins of Decision Making Isolation. It is used in the [Cpp Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines) as the reason to use a class versus struct. But what does it really mean?

## Defining Invariance

In [C.2](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c2-use-class-if-the-class-has-an-invariant-use-struct-if-the-data-members-can-vary-independently), the Guidelines define invariance as:

> An invariant is a logical condition for the members of an object that a constructor must establish for the public member functions to assume. After the invariant is established (typically by a constructor) every member function can be called for the object. An invariant can be stated informally (e.g., in a comment) or more formally using Expects.
>
> If all data members can vary independently of each other, no invariant is possible.

I've read this explanation over and over, but it still never quite made sense in those terms. Let's propose an alternative definition of invariance:

> [!Important]  
> An invariant is a logical condition for the members of an object that can be expected to be true from the time the constructor exits to the time the destructor is called. These logical conditions fall into three categories.
>
> * A relationship between at least two data members such that all members cannot vary independently.
> * A relationship between a data member and a resource (aka RAII).
> * A property of a data member that must always be true.

Let's break down each of these.

## Relationships Between Members

Here's a simple example.

Consider a simple electrical circuit that is characterized by Ohm's Law:

> volts = current * resistance

This means that if you vary any one of the parameters, at least one other must also change. If the voltage increases, either the current or resistance must also increase. If the current decreases, either the resistance will increase or the voltage will decrease. They cannot be changed independently. If we were to code up an object that held these parameters, the parameters couldn't be public members. We'd need to enforce the invariance dictated by Ohm's Law.

```cpp
class SimpleCiruit {
public:
    SimpleCircuit(float volts, float current) : m_volts(volts),m_current(current) {
        m_resistance = volts / current;
    }
    SimpleCircuit(float current, float resistance) : m_current(current), m_resistance(resistance) {
        m_volts = current * resistance;
    }
    SimpleCircuit(float volts, float resistance) : m_volts(volts),m_resistance(resistance) {
        m_current = volts / resistance;
    }
    void setResistanceFixedVoltage(float resistance) {
        m_resistance = resistance;
        m_current = m_volts / m_resistance;
    }
    void setVoltsFixedCurrent(float volts) {
        m_volts = volts;
        m_resistance = m_volts / m_current;
    }
    // ...
 private:
    float float m_volts, m_current, m_resistance;
};
```

In our code, all the parameters are not necessarily linked in this way, and it's not necessarily the constructor that needs to enforce these relationships. For instance, consider this class:

```cpp
class Light {
public:
void setBrightness(uint8_t brightness) {
    if (m_isLightOn) { m_brightness = brightness};
}
void flipLightStatus( ) {
    m_isLightOn =!m_isLightOn;
}
private:
bool m_isLightOn;
uint8_t m_brightness;
};
```

The variable `m_isLightOn` on can change completely independently from `m_brightness`, but the reverse is not true. Therefore, these two pieces of data still have an invariance, or, said another way, the relationship between these two is an invariant.

## Relationship Between a Member and Resource

When a data member needs to have a relationship with a "resource," the [recommended programming idiom is RAII](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#p8-dont-leak-any-resources).

cppreference.com [defines Resource Allocation Is Initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) as:

> Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, or RAII, is a C++ programming technique that binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an object.

RAII establishes a relationship between the data member and the resource. Placing a file handle as a public member would be dangerous, as changing it could create a memory leak. RAII creates an invariance between the member and the resource.

On a side note, I really prefer the term CADRe, or Constructor Acquires-Destructor Releases, as a better name for remembering RAII. However, it's hard to change a term that's been around longer than the Super Nintendo.

## Property of a Data Member that Must Be True

The final type of invariance is similar to the first but isn't a relationship between data members. Instead, there's something that needs to be enforced about a member. Maybe our integer needs to always be even. Perhaps a string can only be a certain length. One of the most common places this is seen is in nontrivial getters or setters for an object that performs some enforcement.

Consider this example:

```cpp
class EvenNumber {
public:
    EvenNumber(int i) { setNumber(i) };
    void setNumber(int i) {
        if ( (i % 2) != 0) { throw std::runtime_error("Invalid input"); }
        else { m_i = i; }
    }
private:
    int m_i;
};
```

Here, the invariance is a condition between a member and the constant *2*.

**TODO** Write how this could open up a can of works by being too broad.

## 'Invariant' Doesn't Mean Immutability

Keep in mind that invariance means a relationship, not that the data cannot change. The term in software for something that cannot change is immutability.

## So Why Do Invariants Matter?

[DMI](dmi.md) uses invariance as one of the key heuristics when determining if a class, a struct, or a free function should be implemented based on [C.2](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c2-use-class-if-the-class-has-an-invariant-use-struct-if-the-data-members-can-vary-independently) from the Guidelines.

## Complete Cpp Core Guideline on Invariance

With these simple examples in mind, here is what the Guidelines say about when to use a class in [C.2](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c2-use-class-if-the-class-has-an-invariant-use-struct-if-the-data-members-can-vary-independently):

> ### <a name="Rc-struct"></a>C.2: Use `class` if the class has an invariant; use > `struct` if the data members can vary independently
>
> #### Reason
>
> Readability.
> Ease of comprehension.
> The use of `class` alerts the programmer to the need for an invariant.

> An invariant is a logical condition for the members of an object that a constructor must establish for the public member functions to assume.

<!-- ## ...but all my data's relationships aren't that simple

Of course, these simplified examples don't fully capture how data is arranged.

==Talk about an example of code where there is an invariance and a bunch of other data and how the data not part of the invariance could be part of a struct in the invariance could be a class in that struct.==

An example could be an extension of the light class. There could be a name field that has nothing to do with any other data. That could be put in a struct that contains a class with the settings data in, and that class would contain the invariance.

An issue is that this starts to break down a bit when you consider that you need a setter that is more complex for the name. What if you need to make sure the name follows certain rules? I'm not sure how that ties in here. No invariance is created, but you need a custom setter.

## special types of invariance

As we dug further and further into this concept, we realized that there are lots of these relationships that don't look quite like these simplified examples. However, the same philosophy can be applied. Among the special cases are

### RAII

### CRTP

### State Design Pattern

### Nontrivial Getters and Setters -->

## But what about when my invariants or data change?

**TODO** Talk about how putting data into classes doesn't necessarily help when you need to introduce an invariant later. You are guessing where that might occur if you choose to stick all your data in the classes just because they might change. By keeping data in small structs that are related, it's fairly simple to make that change later. Changing from setting a variable directly to calling a setter function is it pretty minor refactor.
