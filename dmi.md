# Decision Making Isolation - Practical Guidance for SRP and OCP

Writing code is relatively easy. Writing good code is hard.

The SOLID principles were first published by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob). The LID are relatively easy to understand and implement. The challenging principles have always been SRP and OCP. A few years ago, I began working with some colleagues on creating more valuable unit tests. That's a story for another day, but our answer came to be that code needs to be designed better to be tested. That's led us to a design philosophy that provides practical guidance on how to design better code that fulfills both SRP and OCP. We call it Design Making Isolation, or DMI.
